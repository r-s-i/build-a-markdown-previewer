## Markdown Previewer App

This is a simple React application that allows you to preview markdown text in real-time. It was made as part of taking the freeCodeCamp's Front End Development Libraries Certification. It uses a MarkdownPreviewer component and the react-markdown library to parse and display the markdown.

## Usage

You can clone or download the repository and run it locally.

First, install the dependencies by running:

```
npm install
```

Then, start the development server by running:

```
npm start
```

## Notes

The component uses the ReactMarkdown component from the react-markdown library to parse and display the markdown. Make sure you have it installed in your project before using this component.

The component has a default markdown text that will be displayed when the component is rendered. You can change this default text by modifying the defaultMarkdown variable.
